    "The core Python language and its ecosystem (including many third-party packages) are always changing and improving. As a consequence, some of the code shown in this course needs to be modified (usually slightly) to run with a recent Python installation. A different mismatch is created when something changes in the external world, such as the `mars.nasa.gov` website with which we interact in chapter 3.\n",

    "Nevertheless, the great majority of the content of this course remains informative and up to date. In this document I collect comments and small fixes that will be useful when taking this course in 2020. All comments and fixes are included also in the Jupyter notebooks for each video. Instead of typing along with me, I suggest you open each updated `XX_YY_ZZZZ_end.ipynb` and execute cells (some of which will be slightly different) as I do.\n",

The simplest workaround is to collect the code in a separate script `wordsearch.py` (which we write out in the cell below), and to run it from the shell. When the `multiprocessing` Pool is created, it will automatically import the file `wordsearch` in every new process. Note that the code that initializes and runs the `Pool` is guarded by the clause `if __name__ == '__main__'`: this avoids recreating the Pool recursively."

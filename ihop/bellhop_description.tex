Package ``BELLHOP'' is a ray-trace code, for calculating acoustics.
The package should interact with the MITgcm kernel on various levels 
(initialisation, time-stepping, post-processing).

It starts with taking the hydrography at a single time-step along a track and 
calculates arrival times. Lastly, it output the travel time and ray angle as
diagnostics.
